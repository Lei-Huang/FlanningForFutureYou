ANU Student Experience & Career Development (SECD) is responsible for facilitating a positive and inclusive experience for all students as they transition in, through, and out of University.
Within SECD, the Careers team provide access to services that support career development and employability for all students.
The platform concept is based on gamifying the career development experience. The concept design for the first stage: a paper-based stage, informed by user research and gamification design expertise, that will achieve this goal.

Weâ€™re looking to building an online career planning platform based on the attached prototype and future prototypes. This project will create a platform that will allow students to access long-term career planning and other tools throughout and after their degree.

The platform will allow students to input their career goals and strategise the networking, skills, experience and preparation they will need to undertake to achieve this. 
The TechLauncher program will allow us to semi-digitise the platform and will give the TechLauncher team the flexibility to be as creative as possible.
